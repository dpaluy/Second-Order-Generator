h1. Second Order Generator

Generates dependant siganls with defined probability.

h3. Usage:

 * Define Probability Hash
   p = {'0' => 0.3, '0/0' => 0.8, '0/1' => 0.4}
 * Define amount of generated signals
   @AMOUNT = 1000000

h3. Example

* P(0) = 0.7
* P(1) = 0.3
* P(0/0) = 0.8
* P(1/0) = 0.2
* P(0/1) = 0.4
* P(1/1) = 0.6
